# Git Commit Hooks

TODO: make a project on github that copies an obnoxious hook in on npm setup

<!-- shot() git clone -->

The other day, I cloned another team's project and followed the setup instructions.
I'm trying something out, maybe a refactor, first make a quick commit --

<!-- shot() try to make a commit. The script does a bunch of annoying crap -->

What. Is. This?

Why is it running all this slow stuff? This is a local commit. It should be instantaneous.

<!-- shot() after a while the damn thing rejects my commit -->

What?? it rejected my commit? not OK! What is causing this?
